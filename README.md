The Objective of Cenetra is to provide an easy-to-use mobile-first platform with which:
1. Gives preschools an efficient way to update parents about their child's daily progress, milestones and achievements.
2. Parents and teachers have an easy way to communicate with each other

To achieve the above objectives we have the following main screens: <br />
<ul>
<li>Daily Logs screen
<li>Notification screen
<li>Chat screen
<li>Settings screen
</ul>

## Links
<ul>
<li> Download for iOS:
<li> Download for android:
</ul>

## Future features to be added to the app:
<ol>
<li> A registration page that sends an OTP to the registered mobile number allowing parents to stay logged in.
</ol>

## Folder structure for the frontend
<ul>
<li> src
<ul>
<li>components
<li>screens
<li>redux
<li>navigation
<li>constants
<li>hooks
</ul>
</ul>
  
  The components folder has all the different smaller components that are required for each of the screens. <br />
  The screens folder has all the main views that are viewed by the user. <br />
  The redux folder has all the global state management logic. <br />
  The navigation folder houses the logic for the stack navigation and bottom tab navigation. <br />
  The constants folder has all the information that is required to access custom fonts and colors required by the app. <br />
  The hooks folder has custom defined hooks that are required by the app to avoid redundancy in the app. <br />
