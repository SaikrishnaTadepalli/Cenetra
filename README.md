# Cenetra

## Objective

Cenetra is a mobile-first application designed to facilitate communication between preschools, parents, and teachers. It enables preschools to update parents about their child's daily activities and milestones, and allows teachers to send important notices and updates. The parent platform is a mobile app, while the teacher platform is a website.



## Getting Started

To access the app, both parents and teachers must go through a verification process. They need to enter a unique code provided to them, which will be sent to their verified phone number. This ensures secure access to the app.

## Parent Features

### Daily Logs

Parents can access the "Daily Logs" page from the bottom tab navigator. Here, they can view all the logs and images posted for their child. Clicking on an image expands it for a closer look. Each log contains details such as open-ended questions, checklist questions, and radio button questions.

### Notices

The "Notices" screen displays different types of notices, such as "urgent" or "serious". Clicking on a notice card expands it to reveal the subject, message details, and posting time.

### Chat

Parents can communicate with their child's primary teacher through the "Chat" screen. This feature facilitates direct and efficient communication regarding their child's progress and any concerns they may have.

### Settings

The "Settings" screen allows parents to view and edit their profile information, including primary and emergency contact details, allergies, medications, and blood group. Changes to this information need approval from an admin before they are confirmed. Parents can also manage privacy and notification settings, leave feedback, and contact the school via email, phone, or address.

## Future Enhancements for Parent App

- Ability to edit profile details, including allergies, medications, and primary/emergency contact information, pending admin approval.
- Chat feature for enhanced communication with teachers.
- Download option for media files.
- Support for video files and zooming into pictures.

## Teacher Features

### Home Screen

Teachers are presented with a home screen that displays a list of all the students in their class. Clicking on a student's name allows teachers to view the student's profile but does not provide editing access.

### Daily Logs

Teachers can access the "Daily Logs" screen to view all the students in their class. Clicking on a student's name provides access to all the logs associated with that student. Clicking on a specific log reveals detailed information about the log. If it is today's log, teachers have the ability to edit it. Additionally, there is an "Add New Log" button that is enabled only if a log has not been created for the current day. The log creation process includes pre-filled questions with options for open-ended, radio button, and checkbox responses. Teachers can provide answers and rate the student's overall performance for the day.

### Notices

The "Notices" screen displays all the notices posted by the teacher. Clicking on a notice allows teachers to view the notice type, subject, and details.

### Create Notice

Teachers can utilize the "Create Notice" screen to send information to specific students. They can select the students to receive the notice, add a subject, and provide details. 

### Log Out

The "Log Out" button in the header acts as a navigation bar, allowing teachers to move between pages and exit the app.
